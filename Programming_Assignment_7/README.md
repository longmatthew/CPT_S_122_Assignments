Programming Assignment 7 was to create a few classes that would handle encryption and decryption using a caesar cipher.
I created both in these files, however, the encryption for the substitution algortihm is incorrect - the algorithm should
should make a substitution key that will displace the letters in the alphabet. Based on the shift they are to replace the letters
held within the message that needs to be corrected.

The encryption generates a random number and then shifts the alphabet on that number. Instead it should substitute each letter
at random instead of shifting.
