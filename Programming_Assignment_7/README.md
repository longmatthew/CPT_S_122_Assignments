This program was used to create a cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt files based on old encryption techniques. The Caesar Cipher encryption and decrytpion works as intended however the Substitution Cipher encryption algorithm does not work as intended. I use inheritance and polymorphism to create the cipher algorithms in main and use them in the menu options.

The substitution algorithm shifts the alphabet using a key but instead should replace certain letters in the alphabet at random. This will ultimately be a 'subsitution' of the letters in the message.

This code if for use in teaching and learning and is prohibited in its use for homework, quiz, test or any other academic procedure the evaluates a student or peer on the merits of academic knowledge or integrity.
