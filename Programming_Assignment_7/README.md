Programming Assignment 7 was to create a few classes that would handle encryption and decryption using a caesar cipher.
I created both in these files, however, the encryption for the substitution algortihm is incorrect - the algorithm should
should make a substitution key that will displace the letters in the alphabet. Based on the shift they are to replace the letters
held within the message that needs to be corrected.

The encryption generates a random number and then shifts the alphabet on that number. Instead it should substitute each letter
at random instead of shifting.

=======
This program was used to create a cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt files based on old encryption techniques. The Caesar
Cipher encryption and decrytpion works as intended however the Substitution Cipher encryption algorithm does not work as intended.
I use inheritance and polymorphism to create the cipher algorithms in main and use them in the menu options.

The substitution algorithm shifts the alphabet using a key but instead should replace certain letters in the alphabet at random.
This will ultimately be a 'subsitution' of the letters in the message.

This code if for use in teaching and learning and is prohibited in its use for homework, quiz, test or any other academic procedure
the evaluates a student or peer on the merits of academic knowledge or integrity.
