This assignment was to create a Bank Account class that would except a few options to personalize a users back account. It was 
a very simple desgin for a program although it only keeps track of one back account - the most recent one.

The account class should hold some vectors for name, account balance, account number if the design needed to be reformatted 
to hold more than one account.
