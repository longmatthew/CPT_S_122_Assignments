This assignment was to create a Bank Account class that would except a few options to personalize a users back account. It was 
a very simple desgin for a program although it only keeps track of one back account - the most recent one.

The account class should hold some vectors for name, account balance, account number if the design needed to be reformatted 
to hold more than one account.

This code is not permitted for submission of any homework, quiz, test, or any other procedure that requires the testing of a student or peer.

This program was to create a bank account for a user to log and store their personal infromation into. The bank account was
created as a class and would store personal information such as - account balance, account number, person's name, etc.

The bank account would only keep the most recent record within the program. It could have the capability to reserve room for 
other records; using vectors in this situation would be appropriate. The vector implementation would be used in place of using 'dynamic
memory' in this situation.

This code if for use in teaching and learning and is prohibited in its use for homework, quiz, test or any other academic procedure 
the evaluates a student or peer on the merits of academic knowledge or integrity.
