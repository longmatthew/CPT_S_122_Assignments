This program was to create a bank account for a user to log and store their personal infromation into. The bank account was
created as a class and would store personal information such as - account balance, account number, person's name, etc.

The bank account would only keep the most recent record within the program. It could have the capability to reserve room for 
other records; using vectors in this situation would be appropriate. The vector implementation would be used in place of using 'dynamic
memory' in this situation.

This code if for use in teaching and learning and is prohibited in its use for homework, quiz, test or any other academic procedure
