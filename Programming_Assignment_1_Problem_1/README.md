The first part of this assignment was to sort names or terms in either acending order or decending order. the amount of terms and 
their subsequent size is fixed into a 2D array. The terms are passed to a helper function that will perform a bubble swap to alternate 
the placement of the terms in the array.

This code is not permitted for submission of any homework, quiz, test, or any other procedure that requires the testing of a student or peer.
=======
This program was to assort terms into acending or descending order using a bubble swap. The comparison is made against the
characters held within the terms entered by the user. The terms could have been hard coded but I thought it would be appropriate
for the user to enter the terms in.

This code if for use in teaching and learning and is prohibited in its use for homework, quiz, test or any other academic procedure the evaluates a student or peer on the merits of academic knowledge or integrity.
