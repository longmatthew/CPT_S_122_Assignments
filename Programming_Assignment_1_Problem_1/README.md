This program was to assort terms into acending or descending order using a bubble swap. The comparison is made against the
characters held within the terms entered by the user. The terms could have been hard coded but I thought it would be appropriate
for the user to enter the terms in.

This code if for use in teaching and learning and is prohibited in its use for homework, quiz, test or any other academic procedure the evaluates a student or peer on the merits of academic knowledge or integrity.
