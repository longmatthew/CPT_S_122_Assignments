This program was to simulate a Computer Register using an accumulator, instruction counter, etc. to completely demonstrate 
how a computer will act when given instructions. The program has several arithmetic operations involved in the simulation.

This code is not permitted for submission of any homework, quiz, test, or any other procedure that requires the testing of a student or peer.
=======
This program was to simulate a computer and the components it would step through to perform arithmetic operations. The componentss
include an accumulator, instruction counter, etc. to perfomr the actions that would simulate operations placed on the stack.
The computer simulates several arithmetic operations that are needed in order to complete a bit manipulation although this simulation
does not perform bit manipulation.

This code if for use in teaching and learning and is prohibited in its use for homework, quiz, test or any other academic procedure the evaluates a student or peer on the merits of academic knowledge or integrity.
